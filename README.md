# RandomEnemyMovementTutorial
A written tutorial on how to program random enemy movement using C# in Unity
This tutorial demonstrates how you program enemies to move in random directions, changing the angle of their directions randomly within a certain timeframe that can be set by the programmer.

1. Start by creating a new Unity project named RandomEnemyMovement, for this tutorial we will be using the 2D render pipeline so select this option when creating the project.
2. Once the project is created and has loaded, right click on an empty space in the hierarchy and select (2D Object --> Sprites --> Circle) as shown below.

3. Then we will want to create a new C# script to attach to our game object. Right click on an empty space in the assets box and select (Create --> C# Script). This will create our C# script where we can begin programming the movement for our enemy.

5. Before we start programming, it is good practice to name our game objects, so that our projects are easier to understand. Right click on Circle on the hierarchy and rename it to "enemy".
